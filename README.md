# Text Recognition + Drawing Circles Using Compass + Flickr Images
* A simple app which uses Google's Tesseract API for detecting Text from any image. The Text Recognition app let you draw/write anything with the paint brush tool.
If you wrote some text/character, it will try to recognise it, although it works on characters, but is quite inaccurate when it comes to recognise drawn words.
* You can also draw circles on the canvas using a flexible compass that can rotate, scale and moved using touch gestures (Single and double).
* Flickr Image API is used to get Flickr Images using Retrofit Library based MVVM(Model View - View Model) Architecture.

# Features: 
 * Draw text/character on canvas.
 * Text Recognition using Tesseract API.
 * Drawing Circles using geometry compass.
 * Rotate the compass to draw a circle or an arc.
 * The compass can be Scaled, Rotated and Translated  using multiTouchListener.
 * Application is  very robust.
 * Get Flickr Images using Flickr API
 * MVVM Architecture Used

# Libraries Used:
 * Google Tesseract API
 * Retrofit2
 * Glide
 * Viewmodel and LiveData
