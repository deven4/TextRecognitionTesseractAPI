# Text Recognition + Drawing Circles App
* It is a simple app which uses Google's Tesseract API for detecting Text from any image. The Text Recognition app let you draw/write anything with the paint brush tool.
If you wrote some text/character, it will try to recognise it, although it works on characters, but is quite inaccurate when it comes to recognise drawn words.
* Also, You can draw circles on the canvas using a flexible compass that can rotate, scale and moved using touch gestures (Single and double).
